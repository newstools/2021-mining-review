Canyon Coal appointed Atang Logistics, which is run by Cultura Park local residents Ofentse Tabane and his brothers Mpho and Lebogang, to transport coal from Khanye Colliery to the nearby Bronkhorstspruit siding. Ofentse has been in the industrial and mining sector since 2013, and is responsible for business development at the company. Mpho is an accredited international trader who heads up the procurement and marketing departments, while Lebogang leads the technical logistics operations of the company.

This Family-run company has been in existence for over 20 years largely transporting coal to Eskom power stations in Mpumalanga. The company with a fleet of 25, 34-ton Mercedes-Benz side-tipper trucks – all owned by Atang Logistics – has serviced both large and small coal mining companies. Ofentse has always wanted to work at home but was previously forced to live in different places owing to work needs. “It was extremely difficult for me to find work in Bronkhorstspruit so I couldn’t stay here,” he laments. However, he notes that the relationship with Canyon has been a crucial lifeline for the company, as because of the down turn in the market and the additional pressures placed on the sector owing to the COVID-19 lockdown the company had lost other business contracts. “I am very appreciative for the opportunity that Canyon has granted our company and for helping to save the livelihoods of my family and employees. It is our hope to build on this relationship with Canyon and be part of the company’s ongoing growth trajectory,” Ofentse states. Canyon Coal Group Procurement Manager Carmia Pretorius comments: “Canyon Coal is committed to supporting local, historically disadvantaged South African companies, such as Atang Logistics and integrating them into our supply chain in line with our obligation in terms of the Mining Charter.”
