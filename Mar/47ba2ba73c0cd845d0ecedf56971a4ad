Panthera Resources reports that Moydow Holdings has completed an Induced Polarisation survey at the Kalaka project in Mali which returned eight high priority drill targets. These results are getting a lot of attention! Mark Bolton, Managing Director of Panthera, comments: “These results confirm the effectiveness of the IP technique for exploration at Kalaka. Overall, the results reinforce our view that the project hosts a very large gold system. The high chargeability zone adjacent to the southern artisanal workings is particularly exciting as this was identified as a high priority target before these survey results emerged. “The anomaly also appears to crosscut the general stratigraphy, suggesting it is structurally controlled and is located in an interpreted structurally complex zone within a pressure shadow of an interpreted intrusion, often an excellent setting to host gold mineralisation. At K1A, the IP has highlighted the opportunity for a significant extension to the existing mineralised zone with further new targets identified nearby.” Highlights
