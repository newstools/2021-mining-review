When it comes to extracting diamonds from ore efficiently, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. That’s why Lucara Diamond Corp. turned to TOMRA for their Karowe mine: “We felt, certainly, that the technology that TOMRA offered was the best. But, more importantly, […] it was the approach, the attitude of collaboration and willingness to work with Lucara.
