Live broadcast date: Tuesday, 13 April 202111h00 GMT | 13h00 CST | 14h00 SAST The Democratic Republic of Congo is home to one of Africa’s most mature mining sectors, with multiple large-scale mines that have been operating for decades. But are there still opportunities to grow this industry further? Yes! The junior sector holds the key to unlocking long-term growth and sustainability across the country and there are ample opportunities for exploration, development and production in both explored and unexplored parts of the country. One of the biggest challenges facing this sector, however is the need to secure investment. Fortunately, the DRC’s investment attraction rating has increased in recent years – driven by improved mining legislation and the country’s high grade and high value mineral wealth, particularly for gold and green technology minerals including tin, lithium and cobalt. But is this enough to actually secure the necessary finance/debt to build new projects? Join DRC Mining Week, in collaboration with Mining Review Africa and Africa Mining Forum, as we uncover the investment opportunities in the DRC and highlight the key junior mining projects shaping the industry for the next generation.
