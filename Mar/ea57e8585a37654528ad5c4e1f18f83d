The Mt Todd gold project in Australia is known for having hard ore. Vista Gold turned to TOMRA to find a way to eliminate non-mineralised host rock prior to the grinding circuit, and found that its sorting technologies could do even more for their operation. “We’ve received many benefits from our work with TOMRA. […] First, we’re getting rid of material and we’re not spending money grinding rock that has no value. “Second, we’re now able to do a finer size. With finer grind our gold recovery has gone up. This has resulted in improvements of grade by 10%,” explains Fred Earnest, President of CEO of Vista Gold in this video. Learn more about TOMRA here.
