This has over the past few years seen a rapid increase in the acquisition and development of graphite, lithium and cobalt resources – all well-known battery metals.But what about nickel? According to the Nickel Institute, nickel in batteries helps deliver higher energy density and greater storage capacity at a lower cost. And according to Fitch Solutions, nickel is set to be the primary demand beneficiary of the EV revolution on the metals side in the longer term beyond 2021, significantly ahead of lithium or cobalt.Can Africa participate in this anticipated uptick in nickel demand? Does the continent offer resources worth extracting and if so, what is the timeline on doing so? Join Mining Review Africa and Africa Mining Forum as we unpack this topic in greater detail.
