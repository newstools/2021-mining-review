ASX-listed Syrah Resources has recommenced natural graphite production at its Balama operation in Mozambique ahead of schedule. Syrah has achieved consistent production of on-specification natural graphite at Balama during March to date, positioning it ahead of schedule versus the expected lead time of two to three months for first production. Syrah announced its decision to restart Balama production on 22 February 2021 following a temporary suspension of production in 2020 due to the impacts of COVID-19. The company will progressively increase plant utilisation and production volumes as the full labour contingent at Balama continues to be reinstated.
