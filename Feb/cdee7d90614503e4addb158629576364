After declining in 2019, global gold production was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, while suspension of expansion works and contractions from mines nearing closure also added to the decline. Overall, output was estimated to have declined by 5.2% to 108 Moz, according to GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.

Canada, Indonesia, Peru, and the US will be the key contributors to this growth. Combined production in these countries is expected to recover from an estimated 20.1moz in 2021 to 25.3 Moz in 2024. Vinneth Bajaj, Associate Project Manager at GlobalData, comments: “Key projects expected to commence operations during the forecast period include the Turquoise Ridge underground expansion project in the US, which is currently undergoing construction. With an annual gold production capacity of 500 koz, the project is expected to be commissioned in late-2022. “The Salares Norte project in Chile, which is wholly owned by Gold Fields, is currently under construction. With an annual gold production capacity of 450koz and a development capital expenditure of about US$860 million, the project is expected to commence operations in 2023.” The greatest impact of COVID-19 on gold production was observed during the first half of 2020, when six of the top 10 gold producers reported a collective 8.4% year-on-year (YOY) fall in their output. Major declines were from Barrick (12.3%), Newcrest (15%), and Agnico Eagle (8.4%). While major contributors offsetting the declines were Kirkland Gold (48%), due to the acquisition of the Detour Lake project by Detour Gold in January 2020, and Zijin (5.9%). Several gold mines were forced to suspend operations temporarily due to the pandemic, including Barrick’s Veladero, Pueblo Viejo and Porgera mines and Agnico’s Nunavut, Quebec and Mexican mining operations. China, after reporting an all-time high of 16.7 Moz of gold production in 2014, has been on a downtrend ever since, as a consequence of policy changes and depleting ore reserves. Adding to these factors, the pandemic struck the country’s output hard during the first quarter of 2020. Therefore, China’s gold production is estimated to have declined by 7% to 12.4 moz in 2020, according to GlobalData. The pandemic also had a significant impact on the African operations mainly during the second quarter of 2020, where the gold production is gradually shifting its base towards the Western African countries. Gold mines that were temporarily suspended in Africa include Mponeng, Kalgold and Zondereinde in South Africa, Obuasi in Ghana, Hounde in Burkina Faso and Fekola in Mali.
