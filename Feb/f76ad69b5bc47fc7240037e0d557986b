Vertical shafts is often the only way to access ore reserves for deeper Greenfield operations. The schedule duration and costs of sinking vertical shafts can however often negatively impact the business case. Accessing deeper underground ore reserves, be it for Greenfield or life-of-mine extension (for opencast or decline operations) projects profitably becomes one of the greatest challenges mining companies are confronted with. Finding solutions outside of the conventional approach to shaft sinking projects can help mine owners lower costs whilst gaining earlier access to underground ore reserves. Join UMS Group and Mining Review Africa for a webinar that will explore these solutions in detail.
