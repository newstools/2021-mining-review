Thunder is rumbling and lightening is flashing in the skies over Senegal. The promise of an incoming storm emanates directly from Thor Explorations’ Makosa discovery at its Douta project. The reason? Confirmation of positive results from the drilling programme at the project. Segun Lawson, President & CEO, explains: “Our drilling results at Makosa North extends the mineralised strike length of Makosa by over a kilometre. Furthermore, the mineralisation remains open to the north and at depth. “We will be extending the drill program to follow the mineralisation along strike as Makosa remains a priority for us.
