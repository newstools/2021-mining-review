The Center has identified three focus areas and a set of three-year strategic objectives to orient meaningful outcomes. These focus areas are: Based in Vancouver, Canada, the Center will work collaboratively with the Advisory Council on Indigenous Community Relations, a group of external experts who advise the Safety and Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors.

The Center will work across all of Newmont’s jurisdictions around the world.
