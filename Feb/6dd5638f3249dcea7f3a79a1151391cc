Live broadcast date: Thursday, 4 March 2021 13h00 GMT | 14h00 WAT | 15h00 SAST Coal is the most widely available fossil fuel resource. It forms the backbone of the world’s electricity supply, supplying more than 40% of global electricity needs. It is also a key component in the production of steel and concrete. In Nigeria, coal has been classified by the Federal Government as one of the seven strategic minerals to be prioritised as part of the plan to revive the solid mineral sector. As the country grapples with power shortages, coal mining is expected to generate up to 53.9 gigawatts (GW) of electricity by 2030, building a more reliable electricity supply, lower-cost electrical energy, and expanded industrialisation. However, often cast as a villain due to its environmental impact, the mineral is being shunned by the international investment community, reluctant to inject cash into new projects, making Nigeria’s intention to build a strong coal mining industry a greater challenge. In this session, our experts will discuss the potential for development of coal mining in Nigeria, and explore ways to mitigate the negative environmental impact while staying competitive, through the use of new technologies for coal extraction.
