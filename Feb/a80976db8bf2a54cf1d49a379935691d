ESG leads investment decisions across the globe ESG mining standards are the key to sustainable production. Rather than being a simple obligation, ESG’s have the potential to unlock and become the pillar of sustainable competitive advantage. Investors are realising that companies with a strong ESG track record outperform their peer group, and this has become especially apparent throughout the global pandemic. Companies are moving away from traditional shareholder capitalism toward creating holistic stakeholder value while working to adjust internal metrics of success to help tackle global issues. “One of the biggest ways we’re witnessing this adjustment is the changing face of the financial market, where massive investor funds like BlackRock are looking past usual business metrics and setting Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics as the lynchpin of their investment strategy.” Terence Lyons, CEO, TSC.ai Join TSC.ai in partnership with Africa Mining Forum and Mining Review Africa for a live panel discussion on ESG requirements to ensure the success and sustainability of existing and future businesses.
