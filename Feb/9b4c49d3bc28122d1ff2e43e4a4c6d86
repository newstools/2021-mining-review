Teranga Gold has won a 2020 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Accelerators Award from Global Compact Network Canada, the Canadian chapter of the UN Global Compact. Teranga’s winning submission in the large company category highlights the Company’s contribution to a ‘zero hunger’ goal in communities near the Wahgnion Mine in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Under its Livelihood Restoration Plan, Teranga works closely with local stakeholders to provide education, training and support that has led to increased crop production, new and high-value crops, and improved access to farming areas. “The six-year, $18-million program has yielded numerous benefits for communities neighbouring the mine, including a doubling of agricultural yield for some crops and significant increases in household income,” says Richard Young, President and CEO. “Teranga is committed to sharing the benefits of responsible mining with all our stakeholders and we are proud to work alongside local governments and communities to develop programs that create long-term, sustainable benefits such that the communities and other stakeholders we impact are better off after we have left than before we arrived.”
