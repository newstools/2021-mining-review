Live broadcast date: Tuesday, 2 March 2021 11:00 GMT | 13:00 SAST Having come into effect on 1 January 2021, the newly ratified African Continental Free Trade Area agreement (AfCFTA), with its 35 signatories, is a landmark moment toward achieving the vision of a united and strong African economic market, as advocated for by the African Union since the 1960s. Ratified by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the deal consists of substantial domestic policy and legislation reforms and promises to increase the countryâ€™s production capacity and unlock its commercial potential. It also offers the prospect of generating higher value-added processing opportunities. Join DRC Mining Week and Mining Review Africa to unpack the AfCFTA in detail with expert guest speakers who will outline the legal and technical fundamentals of the agreement and the main principles guiding its effective implementation in the DRC, while uncovering the measures that can build regional and continental value chains, in particular in the mining sector, where the DRC holds a competitive advantage.
