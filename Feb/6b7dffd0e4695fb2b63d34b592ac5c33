Environmental Intern, Ayanda Khumalo and Ngcebo Sibiya, Learner Electrician gave the following thank you address at the ZAC year-end function: We would like to thank ZAC management for giving us the opportunity to have a day of remembrance to think back on the difficult year of 2020. It has not been an easy year, COVID-19 caused the closure of ZAC, which resulted in the loss of a number of our co-workers owing to the mine having to undertake a retrenchment process. COVID-19 also took the lives of many South Africans including our co-worker Happy Twala. We therefore, convey our deepest condolences to all those who lost loved ones due to this terrible pandemic. On a happier note, an internet rage that occurred during lockdown has been the #Jerusalemachallenge which saw people from around the world dancing to Jerusalema, a song by South African DJ and record producer Master KG. September 24 is celebrated in South Africa as Heritage Day and ahead of it, President Cyril Ramaphosa urged people to take up this challenge and show the world what South Africans are capable of. We at ZAC have decided to take part in this challenge and promote teamwork, as we close off 2020 with celebrations and hope for a good New Year in 2021. It is critical that we all work together to restart the operation as many people are dependent on ZAC. In the spirit of optimism and togetherness we would like to put out the challenge to our colleagues throughout the Menar group to come together and build team spirit. We issue the #Jerusalemachallenge to our colleagues at Menar head office, Canyon Coalâ€™s Khanye Colliery and Phalanndwa Colliery, East Manganese and Kangra.
