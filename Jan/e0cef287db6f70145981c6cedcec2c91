Lucapa Diamond Company and its partners have announced the recovery of the 18th +100 carat white diamond by Sociedade Mineria Do Lulo (SML) from its Lulo alluvial mine in Angola. The recovery of this second +100 carat diamond from Mining Block 46 (MB46), a 104 carat D-colour white stone, so soon after the 113 carat D-colour white stone, indicates the potential for these blocks as the company moves deeper into the southern terraces.
