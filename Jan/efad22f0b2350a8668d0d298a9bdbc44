Population growth, a reduction in arable land and changing dietary preferences continue to drive up food demand. The more food crops the world needs to grow, the more potash will be required to ensure that crop yields are maximised and plant health is preserved. Potash and its use in fertiliser manufacture is of vital importance to ensure food security for the forecasted 10 billion citizens that will inhabit the world by 2050.
