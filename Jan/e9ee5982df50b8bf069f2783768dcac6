With precious metal prices hitting record levels, and the aftermath of COVID-19 still being felt, mine owners are looking at maximising their production. High capital costs and long lead times to bring new shafts into production have further emphasised the focus on short term gains to help fund long-term investments in new infrastructure. That short-term focus is on upgrading existing infrastructure. This brings a renewed focus on refurbishing old assets and channelling capital to debottleneck and upgrade shaft and mine projects. Access a recording of a webinar hosted by UMS Group and Mining Review Africa that addresses the challenge of de-bottlenecking vertical shafts to maximise production.
