Or should I say, Endeavour Mining’s Golden Hill? Not quite yet. While the merger of Endeavour Mining and Teranga Gold Corporation is underway, it has not been completed. But I don’t see why it wouldn’t be. The merger between the two companies will produce a company that falls within the global top 10 gold producers, based on existing production. It is however, the exploration assets that could lift the new company even higher in the long term. This could start with Golden Hill – which Teranga describes as a far advanced exploration gold asset in Burkina Faso. Having recently filed an NI 43-101 report on the project, this is a positive sign that Teranga is working hard on bringing its next asset up the curve. It has Sabodala under its belt, and developed the Wahgnion asset (also in Burkina Faso) – from scratch – not that long ago. So what makes Golden Hill a potentially great asset? Well, its gold for starters – need I say more on that point?

We also know that the project has 752 000 oz of indicated mineral resources and another 669 000 oz of inferred mineral resources. But most importantly, we know that both Teranga and Endeavour have demonstrated their ability to deliver new Greenfield mines – on time and on budget in West Africa.

So it may be early stage – but based on the delivery of the Golden Hill technical report, this project has my attention this week, and this year.
