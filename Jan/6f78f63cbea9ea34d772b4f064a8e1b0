Good news then – IronRidge has announced the completion of a Scoping Study on Ewoyaa lithium project, does indeed, confirm that it is an industry-leading asset. CEO, Vincent Mascolo says: “The Study outlines a robust 2.0 Mtpa operation which can deliver excellent cash flows, a very quick payback and a pre-tax NPV of over half a billion U.S. dollars from a modest 8-year operation, producing a course, premium DMS concentrate product.
