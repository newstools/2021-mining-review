The Company continues to explore debt financing options for the underground expansion for those amounts which are expected to exceed the Company’s cash flow from operations during the construction period. The Company anticipates financing to be in place by the second half of this year. The underground expansion program has an estimated capital cost of $514 million and a five-year period of development, with first ore anticipated from underground in 2026.
