AVZ Minerals has advised it has completed a comprehensive independent greenhouse gas (GHG) assessment for the life of mine of its Manono Lithium and Tin Project. The GHG assessment, which was completed by leading global environmental and sustainability consultants, Environmental Resource Management (ERM), evaluated the estimated Scope 11 and Scope 22 emissions associated with all operations over the 20-year life of the Manono mine, processing facilities and road transportation of the products.

ERM’s findings showed the Manono Project could have one of the lowest carbon footprints of any global hard rock lithium miner.

AVZ’s MD, Nigel Ferguson, says: “We will continue to strive towards improving our greenhouse gas emissions profile as we develop the world-class Manono Project.” “Ultimately, we want to see the electricity generated from the Mpiana Mwanga Hydro Electric Power Plant used to operate all our mining equipment, making the Manono Project a 100% ‘green’ mine. “Any surplus power may be provided into the national grid for use in the town of Manono.” “This will be a significant achievement for AVZ and everyone associated with the Manono Project, including our shareholders and our financiers.”
