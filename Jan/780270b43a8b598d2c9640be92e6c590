TSX-listed African Gold Group (AGG) has announced multiple broad high-grade gold intersects near surface at its Kobada project in Mali. Mali – Kobada is an advanced stage gold development project located in Mali, one of Africa`s largest gold producing nations. Drilling highlights include: The drill programme has extended the depth of the oxide-sulphide boundary from an anticipated 110 m to a more realistic 180 m at the northern extensions of the main shear zone, representing approximately 60% increase. This has highlighted the continuity of the mineralisation at depth beneath the current pit design and the presence of high grades to support potential future underground mining at Kobada. To date, AGG has drilled 6,258 m of the combined Diamond Drilling and Reverse Circulation drilling with encouraging results continuing to show deeper than anticipated extensions of the orebody at depth as well as additional mineralised zones outside of the known ore zones. Read: Kobada key to regional success Drill programme unlocks more potential The company`s key internal goal for Q1 2021 is to further demonstrate the considerable potential for an increased resource base Kobada. AGG expects to incorporate the results of the drilling programme in the next mineral resource estimate update on track for early 2021. CEO Danny Callow commented, “We are very pleased with the continued positive results at our flagship Kobada project in Southern Mali. The drilling campaign to date has consistently intercepted deeper oxides and new mineralised oxide zones that were not anticipated in the original plan. “Based on these results we believe that it is necessary to continue to extend the drilling in the Phase 4 infill drilling campaign, as well as look to start to drill the extension of the main shear zone as a Phase 5 programme. We have worked hard to design an extended drilling strategy which we believe will continue to show the true potential of the Kobada deposit,” he concluded.
