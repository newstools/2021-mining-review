In line with this, the company is on track to commission Vatomina in Q2, 2021 and build its production to 6 000 tpa – having commenced the final phase of construction for the first module; this will take the capacity across both projects to 9 000 tpa of flake graphite. The following workstreams have been initiated across the projects: The earth work conducted annually in mining activities is expected see an increase from current c. 200 000 tpa to c. 600 000 tpa across the projects upon completion, while the output of by-product sand is expected to see an increase from current c. 30 000 tpa currently used internally to c. 90 000 tpa. “The expansion of primary graphite output from our Madagascan projects to reach 9 000 tpa capacity is another important milestone and constituent of our development plan,” says Tirupati Graphite CEO Shishir Poddar. “The demand within the flake graphite market is increasing, which is helpful in our endeavours to expedite the delivery of additional capacity. Commission of the Vatomina project will help us further develop the existing markets for our flake graphite and provide quality inputs for our downstream speciality graphite projects.”
