ASX-listed Lucapa Diamond Company has recommenced operations at its Mothae kimberlite mine in Lesotho. Earlier this month, mining operations at Mothae were suspended as a result of a 14 day nationwide lockdown initiated by the government of Lesotho to curb the surge in COVID-19 cases. Following the conclusion of this initial 14 day period, mining and treatment operations have recommenced. Lucapa MD, Stephen Wetherall commented, “It is great to see the Mothae mine operating once again as we prioritise the health and safety of our teams returning to site. With the diamond market continuing its strong momentum into 2021, we look forward to the remainder of the quarter and completing the expansion project on time.” Read: All about Mothae expansion programme The 1.1Mtpa Mothae kimberlite mine in diamond-rich Lesotho commenced commercial mining and processing operations in January 2019.
