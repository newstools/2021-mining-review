Due to a surge in COVID-19 cases the Lesotho Government has imposed a 14-day nation-wide lockdown commencing midnight Lesotho time tonight. Lucapa Diamond Company has had discussions with its partner, the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho (GoL), and a decision has been taken to temporarily suspend mining operations at the Mothae kimberlite mine (Mothae), with appropriate care and maintenance, and security measures. Related: Mothae expansion will increase production growth by 200% Mining and processing operations will be restarted when the lockdown ends. Lucapa MD, Stephen Wetherall comments: “Our priority is to ensure the health and safety of our valued teams on site. The suspension is expected to be temporary in nature as it is a mine operational health and safety decision, not a market limitation. Lucapa continues to engage with its financiers through this period as the diamond market continues its positive trajectory.”
