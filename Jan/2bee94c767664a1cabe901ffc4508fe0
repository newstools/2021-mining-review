Following commercial production at Massawa on 1 September, 2020, high-grade Massawa ore was prioritized for processing through the Sabodala mill, resulting in a record 79,239 oz of gold produced in the final quarter of the year. During its first full year of commercial production, the Company’s newest mine, Wahgnion, produced 175,261 oz of gold, surpassing the high end of its revised 2020 production guidance range of 150,000 to 165,000 oz. Teranga increased Wahgnion’s original production guidance of 130,000 to 140,000 oz mid-year to reflect the outperformance of the plant, which continues to process approximately 25% more material than its original designed capacity. “We have achieved our vision of becoming a low-cost mid-tier gold producer, with two strong operations and a highly prospective organic growth pipeline,” says Richard Young, President and CEO. “Our combination with Endeavour Mining is a natural next step for Teranga and will allow our shareholders to benefit further as owners of a best-in-class senior gold producer poised for continued growth.”
