In 2017, the mine produced approximately 70,000 ounces of gold and sold 67,612 ounces of gold for net revenue received of US$92.65 million.

Firefinch notes that this gold production was disclosed to public exchanges by the previous owners of Morila SA: Barrick Gold and AngloGold Ashanti. The tax department has advised that, based on advice from the government department responsible for customs and exports, it believes the revenue from gold sales for 2017 should be US$146.9 million. The basis for this higher estimate was not provided. The Companyâ€™s internal records and receipts of sales from Rand Refinery in South Africa confirm its production and revenue as disclosed in its 2017 tax return. The Company is confident that the source of information utilised by the tax department to establish Morila SA gold sales is incorrect. The Company believes the Assessment of employment tax, withholding tax, VAT and gold revenue is incorrect and is seeking to meet with the tax department after it has submitted its position, along with the supporting documentation, in coming days.
